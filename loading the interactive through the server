Will need to open two terminals for this. 
The reference on the Anvi'o page is here, which we will follow with some tweaks: http://merenlab.org/2015/11/28/visualizing-from-a-server/

On first terminal, ssh into your account as normal, then start an interactive session:   
```qsub -I -q route -l walltime=0:80:00 -l ncpus=4,mem=4G -N jackie-interactive```

then, load anvio

```module use /mnt/scgc_nfs/opt/modulefiles/common```        
```module load anaconda3```              
```source activate anvio3```          
( Could also load anvi'o 4, see github page on running anvio) 

navigate to the folder where your Anvi'o files are, and run the interactive: 

```anvi-interactive -p SAMPLES-MERGED/PROFILE.db -c AM_ALLmeta_Norm_sccare.db --server-only -P 8099```
( pick a port number if that one is taken or not working) 
You should see a screen that says the server is now listening to the port. 


In second terminal: 
``` ssh -t -t jgoordial@cfe.bigelow.org -L 8099:localhost:8099 ssh c1 -L 8099:localhost:8099```
Replace with your own user ID and whatever port you chose. 
You may see an error "bind: Cannot assign requested address" Ignore it. Do not close this terminal window. 


Go to any browser, and put in the address bar:              

```http://localhost:8099```

(of course changing the ports to match above.
